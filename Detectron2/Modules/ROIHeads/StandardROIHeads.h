		It's "standard" in a sense that there is no ROI transform sharing
		or feature sharing between tasks.
		Each head independently processes the input features by each head's
		own pooler and head.

		This class is used by most models, such as FPN and C5.
		To implement more models, you can subclass it and implement a different
		:meth:`forward()` or a head.

				mask_head (nn.Module): transform features to make mask predictions
				keypoint_in_features, keypoint_pooler, keypoint_head: similar to ``mask*``.
				train_on_pred_boxes (bool): whether to use proposal boxes or
